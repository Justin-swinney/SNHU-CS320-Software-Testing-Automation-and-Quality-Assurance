  - Ensuring that code written is secure and functional can be accomplished through various unit testing and integration testing while security can be accomplished through static testing as well as other testing like dependency checker. Ensuring edge cases are met and all functionality is covered in test cases to avoid future bugs and lost money as well.

**How do I approach designing software?**

- I like to approach designing software with a open and creative mindset, I tend to Invision each step of operation in my head while reviewing the requirements. I tend to create a small example of the functionality of the program on paper and try to find the best structure to use with future modifications in mind.
